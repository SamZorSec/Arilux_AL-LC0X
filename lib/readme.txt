This directory is intended for project specific (private) libraries.
PlatformIO will compile them to static libraries and link them to executable files.

The source code of each library should be placed in separate directories, like
"lib/private_lib/[here are source files]".

For example, see the structure of the following two libraries `Foo` and `Bar`:

|--lib
|  |
|  |--Bar
|  |  |--docs
|  |  |--examples
|  |  |--src
|  |     |- Bar.c
|  |     |- Bar.h
|  |  |- library.json (optional, custom build options, etc) https://docs.platformio.org/page/librarymanager/config.html
|  |
|  |--Foo
|  |  |- Foo.c
|  |  |- Foo.h
|  |
|  |- readme.txt --> THIS FILE
|
|- platformio.ini
|--src
   |- main.c

Then in `src/main.c` you should use:

#include <Foo.h>
#include <Bar.h>

// rest H/C/CPP code

PlatformIO will find your libraries automatically, configure preprocessor's
include paths and build them.
